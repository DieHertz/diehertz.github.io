    <h2>Taming C++/Python Bindings in a Monorepo</h2>

    <p>In any Bazel-based C++/Python monorepo, defining pybind11 bindings can quickly become repetitive and error-prone. I noticed engineers repeatedly hand-writing boilerplate Bazel targets, hardcoding module names in <code>PYBIND11_MODULE(...)</code>, and running into linking issues—especially when combining C++ dependencies like Boost, NumPy, and custom shared libraries.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Without a consistent approach, people reinvented the same glue over and over—introducing bugs, fragility, and wasted time. Embedding Python into C++ applications made things even more brittle due to mixed static/dynamic linking of native libraries.</p>

    <h3>The Solution: <code>py_binding</code> + <code>DEFINE_BINDING_MODULE</code></h3>
    <p>I built a system that lets developers declare a single Bazel rule to define their Python module. It handles all the dependencies (Python, C++, NumPy, Boost) and generates predictable import paths.</p>

    <p>Instead of this:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>cc_binary(
    name = "my_stuff.so",  # have to get the name right or Python won't be able to load it
    srcs = ["bindings.cpp"],
    deps = [...],
    linkshared = True,
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    copts = ["-fPIC"],
)
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You just write:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>py_binding(
    name = "my_stuff",
    srcs = ["bindings.cpp"],
    py_srcs = ["__init__.py"],
)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The macro <code>DEFINE_BINDING_MODULE</code> replaces <code>PYBIND11_MODULE</code> and uses Bazel target metadata to set the module name automatically (dots and other invalid characters are sanitized), reducing duplication and making renames safe:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>DEFINE_BINDING_MODULE(my_stuff) {
    // binding logic here
}</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Embedded Python & Mixed Linking</h3>
    <p>One of the trickiest problems was with embedded Python: if a statically linked native lib is also loaded dynamically by a pybind11 module, things break.</p>

    <p>To solve this, I added support for "embedded" variants of the modules. These take precedence over the dynamically loaded ones via logic in the generated <code>.py</code> file. This approach resolved crashes and symbol conflicts in complex applications.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>try:
    from embedded_my_stuff import *
except ImportError:
    from .my_stuff import *
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The setup relies on Bazel-based code generation to automate this logic, ensuring a consistent experience across targets.</p>

    <h3>Future Vision</h3>
    <p>My longer-term plan was to introduce custom Bazel rules (<code>cc_binary</code>, <code>py_binary</code>) that would propagate binding metadata to the final binary and control linking strategy automatically. Even without full automation, this setup made embedding safer and far more predictable.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This system turned out to be a quiet enabler. Developers stopped tripping over edge cases, reuse increased, and many hard-to-debug crashes simply disappeared. And while it’s not open-sourced, I wanted to share the story—it might resonate with others solving similar problems in large, mixed-language codebases.</p>
